        <p class="w3-container w3-cell w3-half"> While COVID was raging on, I was able to train with my friends in small groups and then eventually we were able to meet as a team. This took forever but this is where I started training at the highest level. I was pushing myself to be better and to run with faster people. I was switching between Varsity and JV for most of the season until JV leagues. I outkicked a Rock Canyon kid and won the meet with a time of 16:36. I was lucky enough to be placed on the regional team and then the State team. We took 1st place as a team at State and I ran 17:00 and placed 35th. Since COVID canceled NXN, we went to a new meet called RunningLane which was hosted in Alabama. I ran 15:39 here and we placed 3rd place as a team. I started to think of where I wanted to go to college.

            The spring was a little rough for me. I was battling sickness and some injuries but I was able to train through and race well. We went to Arizona as a team where I ran 9:41 for 2 miles and then came back the next day to run 4:34 in the mile. Major PR's for me and I was happy. Once I was able to race again I ran 4:33 at altitude and then 2:00.7 in the 800. Luckily one of my teammates dropped the 4x8 relay for the state meet as he focused on 2 other events and I was placed onto the team. We ran 7:57 as a team and I split 1:59 high. We won the relay and I couldn't have been more excited but also hungry for more.
