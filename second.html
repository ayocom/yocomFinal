        <p class="w3-container w3-cell w3-half"> Over the summer I trained really hard with my fellow sophomore teammates. I was determined to make a huge improvement in my fitness. I slowly ran faster and faster times. I met the freshmen this year and they were quiet but hardworkers who pushed me during workouts and races. I was looking forward to the biggest race of my season: NXR. In Arizona, the team ran extremely well. I ran a huge PR of 16:39! The Varsity guys got 2nd place and made it to NXN in Portland. Seeing them make it to nationals motivated me to train hard and smart.

            Over the winter I improved a lot. I was starting to run more often with current Varsity members. I ran the mile at the Air Force indoor track meet but did not break the 5 minute barrier. In March, COVID-19 hit and the track season was shut down. Luckily we were able to meet up and run some time trials where I was able to break 5 minutes twice.
